I am a Dad, a maker and a software engineer who thoroughly enjoys the cybersecurity sector.

I've been a software engineer for over 10+ years in various industries but have found my way professionally back
to the field I am most passionate about and that is cybersecurity.

Have been spending a fair amount of time in the NDR (Network Detection and Response) realm but also participated
in the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) game too.  Coming from a Cisco background I do find myself
really enjoying the NDR space, in particular around: threat hunting, pcap collection and enrichment, all the way
 to sensor appliance management and configuration.
